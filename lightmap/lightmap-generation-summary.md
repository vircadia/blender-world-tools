# Lightmap Generation Script for Blender

## Current Functionality

- Processes selected mesh objects in Blender
- Groups objects by shared materials
- Creates or ensures proper UV maps for lightmapping
- Unwraps UV maps for each material group
- Bakes lightmaps for each material group independently
- Handles different resolutions based on group size
- Sets up appropriate bake settings for quality results

## Script Workflow

1. Initializes settings and data structures
2. Processes each selected object, preparing it for lightmapping
3. Groups objects by material
4. For each material group:
   - Unwraps the UV maps
   - Bakes the lightmaps
5. Completes the process with a final print statement

## Integration Plans for Vircadia World Tools Plugin

- Incorporate the lightmap generation functionality into the existing plugin structure
- Implement a progress tracking system using Blender's UI toolkit:
  - Add a progress bar in the plugin's panel to show overall progress
  - Use Blender's status bar for detailed step-by-step updates
- Create a dedicated operator for lightmap generation within the plugin
- Add user-configurable settings for lightmap resolution, bake samples, etc.
- Implement error handling and user notifications for a smoother experience
- Ensure the lightmap generation process doesn't freeze Blender's UI by potentially using a background processing approach
- Add a log window or panel to display detailed progress information for users who need it

## Future Enhancements

- Optimize the baking process for very large scenes
- Add options for different lightmap types (e.g., indirect only, full global illumination)
- Implement a preview system for quick lightmap quality checks
- Add the ability to save and load lightmap generation presets

This script lays the foundation for efficient lightmap generation in Blender, with plans to integrate it into the Vircadia World Tools plugin for enhanced functionality and user experience.
